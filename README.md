# Seminar-NLP-Understanding-Idiomatic-Expressions

This seminar work presents the work that addresses two of the most challenging tasks in NLP, partaining to langauge learning in specific and applications like sentiment analysis, machine translation etc in general.
Case studies reveal that a good percentage of non native language speakers have limited knowledge of collocations. A 3 staged system was proposed that can automatically detect unexpected collocations in learner corpus. 
The implemented model is then evaluated at each stage to derive potential areas of improvement. We then introduce the second challenge of disambiguating potentially idiomatic expressions. 
Related past works reveal the usage of directional word embedding models in earlier works. However we discuss a BERT based methodology, that uses bidirectional contextual embeddings to disambiguate a PIE in a given context. 
We use the BERT model in both supervised and unsupervised settings and results show that the proposed method outperforms previous state of the art.
To conclude, we discuss some sources of errors and pointers for future work.
